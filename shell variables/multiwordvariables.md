# Multi-word Variables

**Flag:** pwn.college{gFzLMCdogoi-yogdRvvEadutJGa.QXwYTN0wyM1AzNzEzW}

**What I learnt:** to add spaces etc to a variable, use "" so as to not confuse the shell

**How I solved it:**

```
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{gFzLMCdogoi-yogdRvvEadutJGa.QXwYTN0wyM1AzNzEzW}
