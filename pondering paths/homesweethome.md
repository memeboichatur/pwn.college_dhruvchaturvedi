key: 



what I learnt :

The ~ in the prompt is the current working directory, with ~ being shorthand for /home/hacker.

Whenever bash sees ~ provided as the start of an argument in a way consistent with a path, it will expand it to your home directory



how I solved it: 

wrote the command /challenge/run ~/a which basically created a new file named 'a' and stored the key into that.
