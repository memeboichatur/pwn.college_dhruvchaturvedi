we are learning how to navigate through the file system

the parent(biggest) directory is called the root dir

root is also denoted by /



a path is the path(route) the computer should take to reach your required files

the file system layout: 



/usr -(unix system resource) contains all system files

/usr/bin contains all executable files on the comp

/user/lib contains shared libraries

/usr/share contains program resources

/home contains user onwed data

/tmp contains runtime process data



cd -> change dir

cd / -> go back to root dir

cd home -> go to home dir

pwd -> print working directory

ls -> list files in dir



absolute paths start with / (root)

relative paths don't start with / and are relative to current working dir

/. signifies current dir

/.. signifies going up one dir
