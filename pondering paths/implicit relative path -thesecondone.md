what I learnt: linux explicitly avoids automatically looking in the current directory when you provide a "naked" path

learnt how to explicitly use relative paths to launch the run command.



how I solved it: navigated to the challenge dir

as Linux does not run commands like run directly due to safety reasons, I used ./run which was a relative command .
