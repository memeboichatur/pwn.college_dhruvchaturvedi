# Tab Completion

**Flag:** pwn.college{wtvHjOR94jabCYCx0yrr5SzVjEm.0FN0EzNxwyM1AzNzEzW}

**What I learnt:** A safer alternative when you are trying to specify a specific target is tab completion. If you hit tab in the shell, it'll try to figure out what you're going to type and automatically complete it

**How I solved it:**

used the tab key to autocomplete the following command 

``` 
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{wtvHjOR94jabCYCx0yrr5SzVjEm.0FN0EzNxwyM1AzNzEzW}

```
